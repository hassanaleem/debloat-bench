Confine can be used to generate restrictive Seccomp profiles for Docker
images. Due to the nature of OS virtualization technologies, such as Docker,
isolation among different containers is enforced at the software layer in the
Linux kernel.
By prohibiting access to unnecessary system calls, we target reducing the
attack surface of the Linux kernel.
With reliability and soundness in mind, Confine has been built mainly
using static analysis.
To gain a better understanding of how Confine works we provide an overview in
this section. We suggest reading our

for more details.</p>

<h2>Call Graph Extraction</h2>
</div>

<div class="tabcontent">
<p>
We have used an LLVM pass to create a call graph for musl-libc
which maps all the exported functions to system calls. We also used the
gcc RTL and the egypt tool to create a call graph for glibc.
We mainly rely on these two call graphs along with the functions imported from
these two libraries in other applications and libraries to generate the list
of required system calls.
